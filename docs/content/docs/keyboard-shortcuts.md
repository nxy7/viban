# Keyboard Shortcuts

Viban is designed for keyboard-centric navigation. You can perform most actions without touching the mouse, making task management faster and more efficient.

## Viewing Available Shortcuts

Press `Shift + ?` anywhere in the application to open the keyboard shortcuts help modal. This shows all currently available shortcuts based on your current context.

## Global Shortcuts

These shortcuts work from anywhere on the board:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift + ?` | Show keyboard shortcuts help |
| `n` | Create new task |
| `/` | Focus search box |
| `,` | Open board settings |

## Task Panel Shortcuts

When a task panel is open, these shortcuts become available:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `←` | Navigate to previous task |
| `→` | Navigate to next task |
| `f` | Toggle fullscreen mode |
| `Ctrl + D` | Duplicate task |
| `Ctrl + H` | Toggle task details visibility |
| `Backspace` | Delete task |
| `Escape` | Close task panel |

## Development Shortcuts

These shortcuts help you quickly access development tools:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + E` | Open task worktree folder in file manager |
| `Ctrl + C` | Open task worktree in code editor |
| `Ctrl + P` | Create PR or open existing PR |

## Image Support

When editing task descriptions or chat messages:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + V` | Paste image from clipboard |

Images are automatically embedded inline and stored with the task.

## Tips

- Shortcuts only work when not focused on text input fields (except where noted)
- The shortcuts help modal (`Shift + ?`) dynamically shows only shortcuts available in your current context
- Use `Escape` to close any open modal or panel
